# EMERGENCY DEPLOYMENT REQUIRED

## Problem
Production site deployed OLD CODE that lacks:
- Orange menu highlighting (#D67C4A)
- Latest admin improvements
- Force-clean markers were IGNORED by Replit

## Evidence
✅ Current development code HAS orange highlighting  
✅ Git commits show proper implementation  
❌ Production site shows NO orange highlighting  
❌ Old version deployed despite deployment markers

## Solution
**Manual Force Deployment Required**

1. Try deployment again with new emergency markers
2. If still fails, contact Replit support about deployment cache issues
3. Alternative: Use different deployment trigger method

## Current Status
- Development: ✅ Working correctly
- Production: ❌ Old cached version deployed
- Deployment markers: ❌ Not effective against Replit caching
