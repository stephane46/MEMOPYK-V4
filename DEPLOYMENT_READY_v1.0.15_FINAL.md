# MEMOPYK v1.0.15 - Test Player & VideoOverlay Fix - DEPLOYMENT READY

## ðŸ§ª Critical Test Configuration Applied
**Test Player Modified for Hero Video Comparison:**
- âœ… Test player now uses **VideoHero1.mp4** (exact same file as working hero videos)
- âœ… Console shows successful loading: `readyState: 4, networkState: 1`
- âœ… This will help isolate whether issue is filename-specific or server-side

## ðŸŽ¯ VideoOverlay Component Fixed (v1.0.14)
**Applied exact hero video structure:**
- âœ… Fixed duplicate `onLoadedMetadata` attribute
- âœ… Uses identical video element structure as working hero videos
- âœ… Enhanced v1.0.15 debugging output for production verification

## ðŸ“Š Test Comparison Strategy
When you deploy and test, you'll see:

**1. Hero Videos in Hero Section:**
- Should work (currently working in development)

**2. Test Player (VideoHero1.mp4):**
- Should work if server is fine
- Will fail if production server has issues with video proxy

**3. Gallery Video Modal (gallery_Our_vitamin_sea_rework_2_compressed.mp4):**
- Should work if it's only a filename issue
- Will fail if server has broader video proxy problems

## âœ… Production Build Complete
- **Version**: v1.0.15
- **Frontend Bundle**: 1,370.44 kB (387.56 kB gzipped)
- **Build Status**: Success
- **VideoOverlay**: Fixed component structure
- **Test Player**: Modified to use hero video for comparison

## ðŸš€ Ready for Deployment
Deploy this version to test:
1. **Hero videos** (should work)
2. **Test player with VideoHero1.mp4** (isolation test)
3. **Gallery video modal** (the real test)

The test player comparison will help us determine if the issue is:
- Server-side processing problem
- Filename-specific issue
- VideoOverlay component (now fixed)

**Deploy now to run the comparison test.**
