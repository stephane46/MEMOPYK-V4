Video Gallery Crop

Fix critical gallery display inconsistency between admin and public interfaces

PROBLEM RESOLVED:
- Admin gallery was using aspect-video (16:9) ratio for 300Ã—200 static images
- This caused cropping issues where dog's head and eyes were cut off
- Public gallery correctly used 3:2 aspect ratio matching image dimensions
- User experienced frustrating display inconsistency between interfaces

TECHNICAL CHANGES:
- Changed admin gallery container from `aspect-video` to `aspect-[3/2]` 
- Modified client/src/components/admin/GalleryManagement.tsx line 1022
- Both admin and public galleries now use identical 3:2 aspect ratios
- Ensures consistent image display across all gallery interfaces

RESULT:
- Gallery thumbnails display properly in both admin and public views
- Cropped images show identical formatting everywhere
- No more confusion between admin and public image presentations
- Professional consistent user experience achieved

Files modified:
- client/src/components/admin/GalleryManagement.tsx
- replit.md (documentation update)
