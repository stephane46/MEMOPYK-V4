# CACHE SYNCHRONIZATION ISSUE RESOLVED v1.0.125

## Issue Summary
Production admin panel and public site were showing different gallery images despite using the same database.

## Root Cause Analysis
- **NOT** wrong deployment versions
- **NOT** server-side caching issues  
- **NOT** database synchronization problems

**Actual Issue**: React Query cache key mismatch between components
- Admin panel: `queryKey: ['/api/gallery']`
- Public site: `queryKey: ['/api/gallery', 'public', refreshKey]`

## Solution Applied
1. **Unified Cache Keys**: Both admin and public use `['/api/gallery']`
2. **Aggressive Cache Settings**: 
   - `staleTime: 0` (no stale data)
   - `gcTime: 0` (immediate cleanup)
   - `refetchInterval: 5000` (5-second polling)
3. **Proper Invalidation**: Admin updates trigger cache refresh

## Results
✅ Real-time synchronization between admin and public site
✅ Gallery images update immediately across environments
✅ No deployment version issues
✅ Database connectivity confirmed working

## Technical Insight
The development environment was working correctly because it already used unified cache keys. The production issue was isolated cache states preventing cross-component synchronization.

**Key Learning**: Cache architecture must be consistent across all components accessing the same data source.
