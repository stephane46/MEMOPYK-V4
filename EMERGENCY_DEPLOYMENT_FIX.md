# EMERGENCY DEPLOYMENT FIX - v1.0.10

## THE PROBLEM
Replit Deployments is using a cached OLD BUILD (v1.0.9) from hours ago, not the current build (v1.0.10).

## THE EVIDENCE
- Your production error logs show "PRODUCTION ERROR v1.0.9"
- Local development shows "PRODUCTION BULLETPROOF v1.0.10"
- We've built v1.0.10 multiple times but Replit keeps deploying v1.0.9

## THE SOLUTION - FORCE NEW DEPLOYMENT

### Option 1: Force Clean Deployment
1. Go to Replit Deployments tab
2. Click on the deployment settings (gear icon)
3. Look for "Clear build cache" or similar option
4. Redeploy

### Option 2: Create New Deployment
1. Delete the current deployment
2. Create a fresh new deployment
3. This forces Replit to use the current code

### Option 3: Manual Deployment Override
1. In Deployments tab, look for "Build settings"
2. Change the build command to: `rm -rf dist && npm run build`
3. This forces a clean build every deployment

## WHAT'S IN v1.0.10
- Fixed double encoding bug in server/routes.ts
- Removed problematic Pom Gallery video from JSON backup
- Only "Our Vitamin Sea" video remains (which works)

## VERIFICATION
After deployment, check the logs. You should see:
- "PRODUCTION BULLETPROOF v1.0.10" (not v1.0.9)
- No 500 errors for gallery videos
