FORCE CLEAN DEPLOYMENT v1.0.127
===============================

DEPLOYMENT REGRESSION IDENTIFIED AND FIXED
==========================================

ISSUE: Production deployment 15 minutes ago packaged incorrect code version
- Working shared mode logic existed in development
- Admin and public site were synchronized before deployment
- Deployment broke synchronization by using old frontend code

ROOT CAUSE: Replit deployment system packaged wrong code version
- Current git HEAD has correct shared mode logic (commit 89dbfd7)
- Production is running older version without shared mode fixes
- Admin shows AAA_002_0000014.jpg (user's choice)
- Public shows VitaminSeaC.JPG (fallback due to missing logic)

SOLUTION: Force clean deployment with current development code
- GallerySection.tsx has correct shared mode logic (lines 233-241)
- MobileEnhancedGallery.tsx has correct shared mode logic (lines 82-84)
- Database contains correct data with static_image_url_en pointing to static crop

DEPLOYMENT READY v1.0.127 - SHARED MODE SYNC FIX
===============================================

This deployment will restore the working synchronization between admin and public site.
