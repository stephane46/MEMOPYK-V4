# EMERGENCY PRODUCTION FIX - v1.0.138

## ✅ ISSUES RESOLVED
1. **"Unknown" badge removed** - VideoSourceIndicator debug component removed from production gallery
2. **TypeScript errors fixed** - Clean compilation without errors
3. **JavaScript errors resolved** - No more runtime crashes on main page

## ❌ REMAINING CRITICAL ISSUE
**Gallery videos still returning 500 errors in production**

## ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS
From console logs, I can see:
- Gallery video URLs are correctly generated: `PomGalleryC.mp4`, `VitaminSeaC.mp4`, `safari-1.mp4`
- Video proxy calls are being made: `/api/video-proxy?filename=...`
- BUT: Production is still running OLD version `v1.0.1754928443` instead of NEW version `v1.0.1754932191.ULTRA_DETAILED_LOGGING`

## IMMEDIATE DEPLOYMENT REQUIRED
The ultra-detailed logging version will capture exactly why gallery videos fail while hero videos work.

**Version status:**
- Ready: `v1.0.1754932191.ULTRA_DETAILED_LOGGING` (complete error tracking)
- Production: `v1.0.1754928443` (outdated, no detailed logging)

## POST-DEPLOYMENT ACTION
Once deployed, production logs will show:
1. Complete request headers comparison
2. File system analysis for gallery videos  
3. Exact failure point (likely missing gallery video files in production cache)
4. Step-by-step processing breakdown

**DEPLOY IMMEDIATELY TO RESTORE GALLERY VIDEO FUNCTIONALITY**
