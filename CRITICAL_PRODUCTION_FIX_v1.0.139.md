# CRITICAL PRODUCTION FIX - v1.0.139

## ðŸš¨ EMERGENCY FIXES APPLIED

### 1. Analytics Session Endpoint Fixed
**CRITICAL**: Fixed 404 errors for `/api/analytics/session`
- **Root Cause**: Endpoint was defined as `/api/analytics-session` but production expected `/api/analytics/session`
- **Fix**: Added correct endpoint `/api/analytics/session` with legacy fallback
- **Impact**: Resolves all admin cache failures and analytics tracking

### 2. Gallery Video Cache Bypass
**CRITICAL**: Gallery videos now bypass cache completely
- **Root Cause**: Gallery videos were incorrectly served from cache like hero videos
- **Fix**: Added gallery video detection with forced CDN streaming
- **Impact**: Fixes all gallery video playback issues

### 3. GV2 Testing Page Created
- Clean GV2 page at `/GV2` for video testing
- Section 1: Direct streaming comparison (Hero vs Pom)
- Section 2: Cached streaming test
- Minimal design without headers/footers/banners
