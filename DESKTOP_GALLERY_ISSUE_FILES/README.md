# Desktop Gallery Issue Files

This folder contains all the files related to the desktop gallery image display issue.

## Files:
- `ANALYSIS.md` - Detailed root cause analysis
- `GallerySection.tsx` - Desktop gallery component (86 TypeScript errors)
- `LazyImage.tsx` - Image loading component (working)
- `MobileEnhancedGallery.tsx` - Mobile gallery (working reference)
- `routes.ts` - API endpoints returning snake_case data
- `schema.ts` - Database schema definitions

## Issue Summary:
Desktop gallery shows original images instead of cropped images due to property name mismatch between API response (snake_case) and component code (camelCase), causing runtime undefined values and fallback to original images.

## Solution Required:
Fix all property access in GallerySection.tsx to use snake_case names matching the API response format.
