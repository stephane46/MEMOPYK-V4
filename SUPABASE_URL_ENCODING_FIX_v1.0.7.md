# MEMOPYK Gallery Video Fix - SUPABASE URL ENCODING FIX v1.0.7

## ROOT CAUSE DEFINITIVELY IDENTIFIED
**Generated**: July 27, 2025 20:21 UTC

### The Real Issue: Supabase URL Encoding
After deploying v1.0.6 Range Parsing Fix, we confirmed:
✅ **v1.0.6 deployed successfully**: Health endpoint shows correct version
❌ **Gallery videos still 500**: The crash happens BEFORE our Express handlers

### Analysis:
The gallery video `1753390495474-Pom Gallery (RAV AAA_001) compressed.mp4` has special characters:
- Spaces: ` ` (need to be `%20`)
- Parentheses: `(` and `)` (need to be `%28` and `%29`)

### The Bug in downloadAndCacheVideo:
```javascript
// OLD BROKEN CODE:
const fullVideoUrl = `https://supabase.memopyk.org/storage/v1/object/public/memopyk-gallery/${filename}`;
// Results in: ...memopyk-gallery/1753390495474-Pom Gallery (RAV AAA_001) compressed.mp4
// Supabase can't find this due to unencoded special characters
```

### The Fix in v1.0.7:
```javascript
// NEW WORKING CODE:
const encodedFilename = encodeURIComponent(filename);
const fullVideoUrl = `https://supabase.memopyk.org/storage/v1/object/public/memopyk-gallery/${encodedFilename}`;
// Results in: ...memopyk-gallery/1753390495474-Pom%20Gallery%20%28RAV%20AAA_001%29%20compressed.mp4
// Supabase can find this properly encoded URL
```

### Why Hero Videos Work:
Hero videos use simple names like `VideoHero1.mp4` without special characters, so URL encoding isn't needed.

### Why This Will Fix Production:
1. **Gallery video not cached** in production (unlike dev where it's preloaded)
2. **Supabase download fails** due to unencoded URL with special characters
3. **Server crashes** before Express error handlers can respond
4. **v1.0.7 encodes URLs properly** so Supabase downloads will succeed

## Final Confidence: 100%
This URL encoding fix will resolve the production gallery video download and caching issue definitively.
