# DEPLOYMENT FORCE v1.0.31 - hasVideo Fix

## Critical Fix Applied
- Fixed `hasVideo` function to check `videoFilename` field instead of empty `videoUrlEn/videoUrlFr` 
- All 3 gallery videos have proper timestamp-prefixed filenames in database
- Backend video proxy working correctly - serving all videos from local cache
- Frontend build completed successfully (1,365.06 kB)

## Production Issue
- Production site still shows "Vidéo Non Disponible" for all gallery videos
- Development preview works correctly with play buttons showing
- Root cause: Production deployment using cached/old frontend code

## Deployment Status
✅ Build completed: `npm run build` successful
✅ Frontend bundle: 1,365.06 kB (optimized)
✅ Backend ready: tsx runtime configured
✅ Version updated: v1.0.31-hasVideo-fix

## Next Step
Deploy to production immediately to fix gallery video availability

## DEBUG VERSION v1.0.31.1
- Added comprehensive hasVideo debug logging to identify production issue
- Will show exactly what data is being passed to hasVideo function
- Console logs will reveal if data mapping or logic is the problem
