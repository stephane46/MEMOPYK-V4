# MEMOPYK VideoOverlay Fix v1.0.14 - FINAL DEPLOYMENT READY

## 🎯 CRITICAL FIX APPLIED
**Fixed VideoOverlay component structure as you identified!** 

The issue was exactly what you pointed out - the VideoOverlay component had structural problems. I've now applied the exact same video element structure that works in hero videos.

## 🔧 What Was Fixed
**VideoOverlay Component (lines 252-280):**
- ✅ Fixed duplicate `onLoadedMetadata` attribute 
- ✅ Applied exact hero video event handling structure
- ✅ Updated to v1.0.14 debugging output for clear identification
- ✅ Maintained `<video><source>` structure that works

## ✅ Production Build Status
- **Version**: v1.0.14  
- **Frontend Bundle**: Ready for deployment
- **Backend**: tsx runtime prepared
- **VideoOverlay**: Fixed component structure
- **Debugging**: Enhanced v1.0.14 logging for production verification

## 🧪 Expected Results After Deployment
When you click the gallery video play button in production:

**Before (v1.0.13):**
```
❌ VIDEO OVERLAY ERROR (v1.0.13-debug): onError
```

**After (v1.0.14):**
```
✅ VIDEO OVERLAY FIXED (v1.0.14): loadstart
✅ VIDEO OVERLAY FIXED (v1.0.14): loadedmetadata 
✅ VIDEO OVERLAY FIXED (v1.0.14): canplay
✅ VIDEO OVERLAY FIXED (v1.0.14): canplaythrough
```

## 🚀 Ready for Deployment
The VideoOverlay component now uses the exact same structure as the working hero videos. This should resolve the console error you've been reporting.

**Deploy to test the fix in production environment.**
