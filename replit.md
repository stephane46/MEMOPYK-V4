# MEMOPYK - Replit Project Documentation

## Overview
MEMOPYK is a full-stack memory film platform designed to transform personal photos and videos into cinematic memory films. Its core purpose is to offer a seamless and intuitive experience for creating and managing cherished memory films. Key capabilities include a bilingual (French/English) content management system, a professional video lightbox, robust gallery management with reliable video streaming, language-specific upload functionality, advanced image reframing tools, and real-time preview capabilities. The project aims to capture a market niche for personalized, high-quality video memories.

## Recent Changes
- **HowItWorksSection Content Refinement Complete (January 2025)**: Completely rewrote all three steps with comprehensive service descriptions. Step 1 emphasizes collaborative uploads, all format acceptance, and analog digitization services. Step 2 details narrative arc creation, music/duration/format suggestions, and client input respect. Step 3 specifies 1-3 week timeline with 2 revision rounds included. Updated brand terminology to consistently use "films souvenirs" throughout. Enhanced descriptions provide clear understanding of MEMOPYK's thorough creative process and collaborative approach.
- **Gallery Video Ordering System Completely Fixed (January 2025)**: Resolved critical bug where admin gallery reordering arrows appeared to work but items reverted to original positions. Root cause was twofold: (1) server-side galleryCache serving stale data for 30 seconds after swaps, and (2) admin interface using GalleryManagementNew.tsx component with outdated reorderItemMutation instead of proper swap logic. Fixed by implementing cache invalidation in server routes.ts and updating GalleryManagementNew.tsx with swapItemsMutation using correct /api/gallery/:id1/swap/:id2 endpoint. Gallery reordering now works permanently with comprehensive debugging and race condition prevention.
- **Brand Terminology Update Complete (January 2025)**: Updated all footer and meta tag references from "films m√©moire" to "films souvenirs" (French) and "Memory Film Creator" to "Memory Keepsake Creator" (English) across Layout.tsx, LanguageContext.tsx, and public/index.html for consistent brand messaging.
- **Performance Dashboard Header System Complete (January 2025)**: Successfully implemented new X-Delivery/X-Upstream header system replacing confusing X-Cache-Status/X-Origin headers. System now displays accurate cache delivery methods (HIT/MISS) and upstream sources (supabase/local/other) instead of misleading "Cache + local" terminology. Verified across all routes: video proxy, image proxy, and gallery API. Performance testing confirms hero videos serve from cache in ~16ms vs ~1.7s fresh fetch, while gallery videos correctly show direct CDN streaming as designed.
- **Cache System Static Image Bug Fix Complete (January 2025)**: Completely resolved persistent cache discrepancy where system showed 9 static images instead of 6 after "Cache All Again" operations. Root cause was in video-cache.ts line 968 where forceCacheAllMedia method used deprecated `static_image_url` field instead of bilingual `static_image_url_en/fr` fields. Fixed cache system to properly collect unique static images from both languages, preventing orphaned image downloads (static_auto_1754314561668.jpg, static_auto_1754315173965.jpg, static_auto_1754337679940.jpg). Cache now consistently displays exactly 6 static images matching database with zero orphaned files.
- **Bilingual Static Image Cache Sync Complete (January 2025)**: Fully resolved critical bug where gallery items with `use_same_video: true` were generating separate static images for English and French versions. Fixed server-side logic in routes.ts to enforce shared static images when flag is true. Successfully synchronized database, cleaned up 3 orphaned images from local cache, and downloaded correct referenced images. Cache system now accurately displays exactly 6 static images total (one per gallery item) with perfect bilingual URL consistency. Issue completely resolved and verified.
- **Gallery Static Image Loading Performance Fix (January 2025)**: Fixed 2-3 second delay on F5 refresh by modifying cache-busting function to use static parameters instead of random timestamps. This preserves the existing server-side cache system while enabling browser caching for better performance.
- **Gallery Content Ordering Fix (January 2025)**: Reordered gallery card content display so "Histoire du film" (Story) now appears before "Situation du client" in both admin interface and public gallery. Applied consistently across English and French sections for logical content hierarchy.
- **Gallery Source Text Translation Fix (January 2025)**: Fixed gallery card source attribution text to display proper French translation: "fournies par Client" instead of English "provided by Client" when viewing site in French. Maintains bilingual accuracy across all gallery source overlays.
- **Legal Document Spacing Fix (January 2025)**: Implemented custom CSS class `.legal-document-tight` with balanced spacing (line-height: 1.3, 0.2rem margins) to ensure published legal documents match admin interface formatting exactly. Removed automatic document titles from published pages for complete user control over content presentation.
- **Cross-Page Navigation Fix (January 2025)**: Fixed navigation anchors so clicking header menu items (like "Galerie") from legal documents or other pages now properly navigates to homepage and scrolls to the correct section using sessionStorage for smooth transitions.
- **FAQ Interactive Styling (January 2025)**: Updated FAQ section to use official MEMOPYK beige colors (bg-memopyk-cream, text-memopyk-navy) when questions are opened, with single-question behavior ensuring only one question displays special styling at a time.
- **Rich Text Editor Fix (January 2025)**: Fixed Legal Documents editor toolbar positioning with sticky positioning and proper scrollable container setup. The toolbar now stays visible when scrolling through long content, and the interface uses a clean tabbed approach (French/English) with orange selection styling.
- **Legal Documents List Simplification (January 2025)**: Removed content preview sections with scroll bars from the documents list for a cleaner, more professional admin interface that focuses on essential document metadata and actions.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Visual consistency priority: Extremely detail-oriented about spacing and formatting consistency between admin interface and published pages.
