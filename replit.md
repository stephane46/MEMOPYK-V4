# MEMOPYK - Replit Project Documentation

## Overview

MEMOPYK is a full-stack memory film platform being rebuilt from scratch. Currently in Phase 1 - minimal React + TypeScript + Vite setup with uploaded MEMOPYK visual assets. The rebuild follows systematic documentation to avoid previous technical failures and implement the complete platform incrementally.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

**Technical Decisions:**
- React Editor Future-Proofing: Consider TipTap as React 19 alternative to ReactQuill when needed
- Track ReactQuill updates for React 19 compatibility improvements
- Prioritize stable, tested solutions over bleeding-edge dependencies
- **Typography**: Poppins (sans-serif) everywhere EXCEPT Playfair Display (serif) ONLY for hero video overlay text

**Analytics Strategy Decision (Jan 22, 2025):**
- Remove hero video tracking (auto-play videos don't provide meaningful analytics)
- Focus analytics on gallery video previews and user engagement  
- Track which gallery items are most popular to inform business decisions

**Gallery Video Architecture Decision - FINAL (July 29, 2025):**
✅ **Direct CDN Streaming**: Gallery videos use direct Supabase CDN URLs for reliable production playback

✅ **Fixed Navigation**: Banner remains fixed at top during scroll with proper padding
✅ **Dual-Flag Language Switcher**: Both language options visible with MEMOPYK navy border around active language button
✅ **Cream Header Background**: Navigation header uses MEMOPYK cream background color

**Phase 8 Brand Assets & Visual Polish - Layout Update (July 27, 2025):**
✅ **KeyVisualSection Layout**: Image moved to left side, text content moved to right side for improved visual flow
✅ **KeyVisualSection Cleanup**: Removed floating pill elements (top-right "100+ Films created" and bottom-left "Expert artists") for cleaner image presentation
✅ **HowItWorksSection Fixes**: Fixed card height inconsistency with flexbox layout and prevented image cropping using object-contain
✅ **HowItWorksSection Redesign**: Complete redesign matching current site with dark blue cards, cream image backgrounds, balanced 3-column layout, and authentic bilingual content from screenshots

**Analytics Implementation Status (July 26, 2025):**
- ✅ **Hero Video Exclusion Applied**: All analytics methods now filter out VideoHero1.mp4, VideoHero2.mp4, VideoHero3.mp4
- ✅ **Gallery-Only Analytics**: Enhanced Analytics system focuses exclusively on user-initiated gallery video views
