Its core purpose is to offer a seamless and intuitive experience for creating and managing cherished memory films. Key capabilities include a bilingual (French/English) content management system, a professional video lightbox, robust gallery management with reliable video streaming, language-specific upload functionality, advanced image reframing tools, and real-time preview capabilities. The project aims to capture a market niche for personalized, high-quality video memories.

## Recent Changes  
- **August 7, 2025**: **CACHE STATUS INVESTIGATION COMPLETE** - Discovered and diagnosed automatic cache creation during production deployments. Console debugging revealed cache files are automatically generated within minutes of deployment startup (timestamps showing 09:02:58-09:02:59 when accessed at 09:03:15), explaining why "Just cached" status appears immediately after deployment without manual cache operations. This behavior is caused by automatic file caching during health checks, hero video requests, or admin panel status checks.
- **August 7, 2025**: **ADMIN INTERFACE UX IMPROVEMENTS COMPLETE** - Fixed ugly text wrapping issues in cache status cards where hostnames were displaying across 3 lines and titles across 4 lines. Streamlined header layout using proper flexbox controls, shortened badge text ("Production/Dev" instead of "Production/Development"), made cache counts more compact ("3/3" vs "3/3 Cached"), removed duplicate Smart Cleanup buttons consolidating to single well-labeled button, and added loading spinner with "âš¡ Processing All Media..." feedback to Bulletproof cache button.
- **August 6, 2025**: **SMART CACHE CLEARING SYSTEM IMPLEMENTED** - Completely redesigned cache clear functionality to handle files actively being streamed (hero videos always playing). Uses intelligent rename-and-schedule-delete approach: renames files to .deleted extension (immediately making cache "empty" from proxy perspective), then schedules background cleanup after 5-second delay. This works even when hero videos are continuously streaming since renameSync works on files in use while unlinkSync fails. Admin interface now provides accurate feedback about actual files processed instead of misleading "0 files removed" messages.
- **August 6, 2025**: **COMPREHENSIVE BULLETPROOF MEDIA CACHE SYSTEM COMPLETE** - Extended bulletproof cache system to cover ALL media types (Hero Videos, Gallery Videos, Gallery Images). Implemented `/api/video-cache/force-all-media` endpoint with same verification standards as hero video system. System processes 10/10 media files (6 videos + 4 images) with bulletproof verification: pre-download state capture, download execution, post-download verification, file existence checks, size validation (minimum 1KB), and timestamp verification. Added purple "ðŸš€ BULLETPROOF All Media Cache" button to admin interface for comprehensive media caching. Processing time: ~14 seconds for complete media refresh (290MB total). Admin interface now provides single-button solution for complete production cache warming.
- **August 6, 2025**: **BADGE LAYOUT SYSTEM PERFECTED** - Completed comprehensive badge system overhaul with perfect responsive alignment. Standardized all format badges to use "Format RecommandÃ©"/"Recommended Format" as consistent first line with format type as prominent second line. Fixed responsive alignment issues where Social Media badges were misaligned on desktop vs mobile. Implemented precise positioning using overlay spacing (`right-2 sm:right-4`) to match price badge alignment exactly. Title and badge now appear on same horizontal line with balanced spacing across all screen sizes. User confirmed layout is "Perfect".
- **August 6, 2025**: **ADMIN TEMPLATE SIMPLIFICATION COMPLETE** - Streamlined Format Badge Manager templates to use standardized platform labels exclusively. Updated all predefined templates to use "Recommended Format"/"Format RecommandÃ©" removing confusing platform variations. Admin interface now focuses on managing format types only (Mobile Stories, Instagram Posts, TV & Desktop) with consistent user experience.
- **August 6, 2025**: **GALLERY ORDERING SYSTEM FULLY OPERATIONAL** - Successfully resolved critical ordering bug that was causing new videos to appear in wrong positions. Fixed database field mapping inconsistencies between frontend (order_index) and database schema (orderIndex). Updated updateGalleryItemOrder function in hybrid-storage.ts to properly sync both Supabase database and JSON file storage. Created missing gallery-items.json file that was causing "Gallery item not found" API errors. User confirmed admin interface ordering buttons are now functional and has redeployed the system with all fixes.
- **August 6, 2025**: **COMPLETE CROPPING SYSTEM SUCCESS** - Fully resolved all cropping functionality after comprehensive debugging. Fixed missing database import in hybrid-storage.ts that was causing 500 errors, created missing gallery-items.json file for hybrid storage fallback system, and implemented proper loading spinner with user feedback. Cropping workflow now fully operational: database saves, position calculations, and cross-environment sync all confirmed working. Crop percentages successfully updating (verified: 5.22%, 11.11%, 0%) demonstrating end-to-end functionality.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript and Vite.
- **UI Library**: shadcn/ui (built on Radix UI).
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with CSS custom properties.
- **State Management**: TanStack Query.
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation.
- **UI/UX Decisions**:
    - **Typography**: Poppins for general text, Playfair Display for hero video overlay text.
    - **Color Scheme**: MEMOPYK brand palette (Dark Blue #2A4759, Orange #D67C4A, Navy #011526, Cream #F2EBDC, Sky Blue #89BAD9).
    - **Responsive Design**: Adaptive to all screen sizes, including advanced mobile optimizations (responsive grids, touch-friendly overlays, optimized text sizing, 44px touch targets). Includes PWA features like lazy loading and network status detection.
    - **Navigation**: Customer journey-focused anchor-based scrolling on the homepage. Logo acts as home button with language routing.
    - **Image Cropping**: Inline drag-and-reposition interface with real-time visual feedback and a dual badge system for manual/automatic crops.
    - **Video Display**: Minimal controls for gallery videos, 2/3 screen size lightbox with blurred background. Hero videos use a cache system for fast loading; gallery videos stream directly from CDN.
    - **Admin Interface**: Streamlined content management, professional field labeling, clear visual indicators, responsive font size system with real-time preview.

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js.
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules.
- **Database ORM**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL dialect.

### Key Architectural Decisions
- **Hybrid Storage System**: JSON fallback for all data, complementing PostgreSQL for data persistence and synchronization across environments.
- **Universal Video Proxy**: Manages all video serving, including range requests, local caching, and fallback to Supabase CDN.
- **Image Proxy**: Handles image loading, resolves CORS issues, and prioritizes static cropped images.
- **Cache Management**: Smart caching for hero videos (immediate preload) and direct CDN streaming for gallery videos.
- **Bilingual Support**: Comprehensive French/English content management for UI, data, and SEO.
- **Modular API Design**: RESTful API for various content types (hero videos, gallery, FAQs, legal docs, analytics).
- **Static Image Generation**: Automated Sharp-based cropping and generation of static images for gallery thumbnails upon upload.
