# MEMOPYK - Replit Project Documentation

## Overview

MEMOPYK is a full-stack memory film platform being rebuilt from scratch. Currently in Phase 1 - minimal React + TypeScript + Vite setup with uploaded MEMOPYK visual assets. The rebuild follows systematic documentation to avoid previous technical failures and implement the complete platform incrementally.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

**Analytics Strategy Decision (Jan 22, 2025):**
- Remove hero video tracking (auto-play videos don't provide meaningful analytics)
- Focus analytics on gallery video previews and user engagement  
- Track which gallery items are most popular to inform business decisions

## Recent Changes (July 22, 2025)

### Phase 8.2.2 Gallery UI Improvements - COMPLETED (July 22, 2025)
**Enhanced Gallery Visual Design:**
- Fixed critical video playback bug - removed double URL encoding in VideoOverlay component
- Removed "Video" and "Featured" badges from gallery items for cleaner visual design
- Eliminated redundant play/pause button from video overlay controls
- Single-click video playbook now working perfectly with cached performance (12ms load times)
- Gallery videos auto-play immediately with only restart and volume controls
- Enhanced user experience with streamlined interface design

### Phase 8.2.1 Complete Video Management System - COMPLETED (July 22, 2025)
**All Video Management Functionality Now Working:**
- Fixed "Move Earlier/Move Later" buttons - endpoint mismatch resolved (/order → /reorder)
- Fixed video upload system - missing POST endpoint created for hero video entries
- Fixed inline video preview - removed modal popup, added native HTML5 controls
- Fixed video streaming - resolved pipe function error with ReadableStream implementation
- Enhanced user feedback - improved toast notifications for all operations
- Video caching system fully operational with proper user feedback

**Technical Fixes Applied:**
- Frontend API calls corrected: `/api/hero-videos/:id/order` → `/api/hero-videos/:id/reorder`
- Payload format fixed: `{ newOrder }` → `{ order_index: newOrder }`
- Created missing `createHeroVideo` method in hybrid storage system
- Added proper interface declarations for all CRUD operations
- Enhanced error handling and user feedback throughout admin interface

### Phase 8.2 File Management System Overhaul - COMPLETED (July 22, 2025)
**Complete File Upload System Redesign:**
- Removed timestamp prefix system entirely - now uses original filenames (e.g., VideoHero2.mp4 instead of 1752156356886_VideoHero2.mp4)
- Enabled overwrite capability in both Supabase storage and local cache with `upsert: true`
- Added automatic cache clearing when files are overwritten for instant updates
- Created dedicated hero video upload endpoint `/api/hero-videos/upload` with clean filename handling
- Enhanced admin interface to display clean filenames prominently with technical names as reference
- Fixed toggle switch visibility with proper green/gray color scheme and clear "Plays 1st" indicators

**Technical Implementation:**
- Modified upload endpoints to use original filenames without timestamp prefixes
- Added `videoCache.clearSpecificFile()` method for targeted cache invalidation
- Enabled Supabase storage overwrite with `upsert: true` parameter
- Enhanced filename display logic to show clean names (VideoHero2.mp4) with technical references
- Improved admin interface usability with clear position indicators and status visibility

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds
- **UI Library**: shadcn/ui components built on Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with CSS custom properties for theming
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state management
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation resolvers

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **Database ORM**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL dialect
- **Database Provider**: Neon Database (serverless PostgreSQL)
- **Session Management**: Express sessions with PostgreSQL store
- **Build Tool**: esbuild for production builds

### Project Structure
```
├── client/          # React frontend application
├── server/          # Express backend application  
├── shared/          # Shared types, schemas, and utilities
├── migrations/      # Database migration files
└── dist/           # Production build output
```

## Key Components

### Database Layer
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM provides type-safe database operations
- **Schema**: Centralized schema definitions in `shared/schema.ts`
- **Migrations**: Automated database migrations via `drizzle-kit`
- **Connection**: Neon serverless PostgreSQL with connection pooling

### API Layer
- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Routing**: Centralized route registration in `server/routes.ts`
- **Middleware**: Request logging, JSON parsing, error handling
- **Storage Interface**: Abstracted storage layer with in-memory fallback

### Frontend Layer
- **Components**: Comprehensive UI component library from shadcn/ui
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for API state and caching
- **Routing**: Client-side routing (implementation pending)
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod schema validation

### Development Tools
- **Hot Reload**: Vite dev server with HMR support
- **Type Checking**: Strict TypeScript configuration
- **Error Handling**: Runtime error overlay for development
- **Code Quality**: Shared TypeScript configuration across packages

## Data Flow

### Request Lifecycle
1. Client makes HTTP requests to `/api/*` endpoints
2. Express middleware logs requests and handles CORS
3. Route handlers interact with storage interface
4. Storage layer uses Drizzle ORM for database operations
5. Responses are serialized and sent back to client
6. TanStack Query manages client-side caching and state

### Authentication Flow
- Session-based authentication using PostgreSQL session store
- Credentials stored securely with connect-pg-simple
- Session validation middleware (to be implemented)

### Data Validation
- Zod schemas in shared package for consistent validation
- Frontend form validation using React Hook Form resolvers
- Backend request validation using shared schemas

## External Dependencies

### Database
- **Neon Database**: Serverless PostgreSQL hosting
- **Connection**: Via `@neondatabase/serverless` driver
- **Configuration**: Environment variable `DATABASE_URL`

### UI Components
- **Radix UI**: Unstyled, accessible component primitives
- **Lucide React**: Icon library for consistent iconography
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework

### Development Tools
- **Replit Integration**: Cartographer plugin for code navigation
- **Error Handling**: Runtime error modal for development
- **Bundle Analysis**: Source maps for debugging

## Deployment Strategy

### Build Process
1. Frontend builds to `dist/public` using Vite
2. Backend builds to `dist/` using esbuild
3. Shared types compiled and included in both builds
4. Static assets served from Express in production

### Environment Configuration
- **Development**: Vite dev server with Express API proxy
- **Production**: Express serves static files and API routes
- **Database**: Automatic migration on deployment via `db:push`

### Hosting Considerations
- **Static Assets**: Served by Express in production
- **API Routes**: Express server handles all `/api/*` requests
- **Database**: Neon serverless PostgreSQL with automatic scaling
- **Sessions**: Persistent session storage in PostgreSQL

### Scripts
- `dev`: Development server with hot reload
- `build`: Production build for both frontend and backend  
- `start`: Production server startup
- `db:push`: Deploy database schema changes

The application follows a modern full-stack architecture with clear separation of concerns, type safety throughout the stack, and developer-friendly tooling for rapid iteration.
