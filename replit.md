The rebuild follows systematic documentation to avoid previous technical failures and implement the complete platform incrementally.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

**Analytics Strategy Decision (Jan 22, 2025):**
- Remove hero video tracking (auto-play videos don't provide meaningful analytics)
- Focus analytics on gallery video previews and user engagement  
- Track which gallery items are most popular to inform business decisions

## Recent Changes (July 22, 2025)

### Phase 8.2.8 Automatic Gallery Video Caching System - COMPLETED (July 23, 2025)
**Complete Gallery Video Auto-Preloading Implementation:**
- **Fixed Deployment Issue**: Gallery videos now automatically cache on server startup alongside hero videos
- **Eliminated 500 Errors**: Production deployments will have all gallery videos pre-cached locally
- **Seamless User Experience**: Gallery videos now load instantly in deployment (same as hero videos)
