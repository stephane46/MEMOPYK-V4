The project aims to capture a market niche for personalized, high-quality video memories.

## Recent Changes
- **August 6, 2025**: Resolved desktop gallery image display issue. Fixed data structure mismatch between API response (camelCase) and gallery component (snake_case) by updating all field references to handle both formats. Implemented aggressive cache busting for cropped images. Browser console logs confirm desktop gallery now correctly loads cropped images with -C.jpg URLs matching mobile gallery behavior.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript and Vite.
- **UI Library**: shadcn/ui (built on Radix UI).
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with CSS custom properties.
- **State Management**: TanStack Query.
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation.
- **UI/UX Decisions**:
    - **Typography**: Poppins for general text, Playfair Display for hero video overlay text.
    - **Color Scheme**: MEMOPYK brand palette (Dark Blue #2A4759, Orange #D67C4A, Navy #011526, Cream #F2EBDC, Sky Blue #89BAD9).
    - **Responsive Design**: Adaptive to all screen sizes, including advanced mobile optimizations (responsive grids, touch-friendly overlays, optimized text sizing, 44px touch targets). Includes PWA features like lazy loading and network status detection.
    - **Navigation**: Customer journey-focused anchor-based scrolling on the homepage. Logo acts as home button with language routing.
    - **Image Cropping**: Inline drag-and-reposition interface with real-time visual feedback and a dual badge system for manual/automatic crops.
    - **Video Display**: Minimal controls for gallery videos, 2/3 screen size lightbox with blurred background. Hero videos use a cache system for fast loading; gallery videos stream directly from CDN.
    - **Admin Interface**: Streamlined content management, professional field labeling, clear visual indicators, responsive font size system with real-time preview.

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js.
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules.
- **Database ORM**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL dialect.
- **Database Provider**: Neon Database (serverless PostgreSQL).
- **Session Management**: Express sessions with PostgreSQL store.

### Key Architectural Decisions
- **Hybrid Storage System**: JSON fallback for all data, complementing PostgreSQL for data persistence and synchronization across environments.
- **Universal Video Proxy**: Manages all video serving, including range requests, local caching, and fallback to Supabase CDN.
- **Image Proxy**: Handles image loading, resolves CORS issues, and prioritizes static cropped images.
- **Cache Management**: Smart caching for hero videos (immediate preload) and direct CDN streaming for gallery videos.
- **Bilingual Support**: Comprehensive French/English content management for UI, data, and SEO.
- **Modular API Design**: RESTful API for various content types (hero videos, gallery, FAQs, legal docs, analytics).
- **Static Image Generation**: Automated Sharp-based cropping and generation of static images for gallery thumbnails upon upload.
- **Real-time Analytics**: Backend system for tracking visitors, performance, and engagement with IP management.
- **Direct Supabase Upload System**: Facilitates large file uploads by bypassing deployment limits.
- **SEO Management System**: Comprehensive interface for page-level meta tags, keywords, redirects, image SEO, and global settings.
- **Deployment Optimizations**: Includes fast health check endpoints, production video cache preloading for hero videos, comprehensive error handling, and routing priorities to prevent static file serving interference.
