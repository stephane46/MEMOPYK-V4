# MEMOPYK - Replit Project Documentation

## Overview

MEMOPYK is a full-stack memory film platform being rebuilt from scratch. Currently in Phase 1 - minimal React + TypeScript + Vite setup with uploaded MEMOPYK visual assets. The rebuild follows systematic documentation to avoid previous technical failures and implement the complete platform incrementally.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

**Analytics Strategy Decision (Jan 22, 2025):**
- Remove hero video tracking (auto-play videos don't provide meaningful analytics)
- Focus analytics on gallery video previews and user engagement  
- Track which gallery items are most popular to inform business decisions

## Recent Changes (July 22, 2025)

### Phase 8.2.4 Drag-to-Pan Image Cropping System - COMPLETED (July 23, 2025)
**Revolutionary Simplification - User-Friendly Drag Interface:**
- **MAJOR ARCHITECTURAL CHANGE**: Replaced complex react-easy-crop system with simple drag-to-pan interface
- **DraggableCover Component**: Click-and-drag repositioning within fixed 300×200 viewport
- **Perfect Preview Accuracy**: What you see in preview is exactly what gets saved (1:1 mapping)
- **Real-time Position Tracking**: Live percentage display (0-100% x/y coordinates)
- **Canvas Generation**: Mathematically accurate background-position to canvas offset conversion
- **Zero Dependencies**: Pure React hooks implementation, no external cropping libraries
- **Simplified Workflow**: Upload → Drag to position → Single click to generate and save
- **Performance Optimized**: Eliminated coordinate mapping conflicts and viewport scaling issues
- **User Experience**: Intuitive grab cursor, smooth dragging, immediate visual feedback

**Technical Implementation:**
- `backgroundImage` with `background-size: cover` for consistent scaling behavior
- `background-position` percentages (0-100%) for precise positioning control
- Canvas generation uses exact same scaling math as CSS background properties
- Position state synchronization between preview and final output generation
- **High-DPI Rendering**: Canvas sized at `devicePixelRatio` scale for Retina sharpness
- **Lossless PNG Output**: Zero compression artifacts for maximum image quality
- **Premium Quality Settings**: `imageSmoothingQuality: 'high'` with anti-aliasing

### Phase 8.2.3 Static Image Generation System - COMPLETED (July 23, 2025)
**Complete Static Image Generation Workflow - MAJOR SUCCESS:**

- Enhanced ImageCropper component with proper UUID handling for gallery item IDs
- Implemented complete 300×200 JPEG static image generation and upload workflow
- Fixed image upload API endpoint to properly handle cropped image data and settings storage
- Successfully tested end-to-end: crop selection → JPEG generation → Supabase upload → database storage
- Static images now generated with original filename prefix (static_[item_id].jpg) for clean organization
- **CRITICAL BREAKTHROUGH**: Fixed image cropping to extract directly from original 4032×3024 source image
- **Direct Original Mapping (v12)**: Eliminated intermediate canvas processing and scaled preview cropping issues
- **Fixed Gallery Aspect Ratio**: Static images now display in proper 3:2 ratio instead of compressed 16:9
- **Perfect Crop Accuracy**: System now extracts exactly what user selects in orange crop frame
- **User Verified Success**: Marina scene with boats and buildings properly extracted and displayed
- **IMPLEMENTATION - Viewport Alignment**: Replaced react-easy-crop coordinate system with mathematical calculation
- **IMPLEMENTATION - Preview System**: Two-step confirmation (Aperçu → green preview → Confirmer & Sauvegarder)
- **FINAL EVOLUTION**: Simplified to drag-to-pan interface for optimal user experience

### Phase 8.2.2 Gallery UI Improvements - COMPLETED (July 22, 2025)

- Enabled overwrite capability in both Supabase storage and local cache with `upsert: true`
- Added automatic cache clearing when files are overwritten for instant updates
- Created dedicated hero video upload endpoint `/api/hero-videos/upload` with clean filename handling

- **Session Management**: Express sessions with PostgreSQL store
- **Build Tool**: esbuild for production builds

### Project Structure
```
├── client/          # React frontend application
├── server/          # Express backend application  
├── shared/          # Shared types, schemas, and utilities
├── migrations/      # Database migration files
└── dist/           # Production build output
```

## Key Components

### Database Layer
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM provides type-safe database operations
- **Schema**: Centralized schema definitions in `shared/schema.ts`
- **Migrations**: Automated database migrations via `drizzle-kit`
- **Connection**: Neon serverless PostgreSQL with connection pooling

### API Layer
- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Routing**: Centralized route registration in `server/routes.ts`
- **Middleware**: Request logging, JSON parsing, error handling
- **Storage Interface**: Abstracted storage layer with in-memory fallback

### Frontend Layer
- **Components**: Comprehensive UI component library from shadcn/ui
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for API state and caching
- **Routing**: Client-side routing (implementation pending)
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod schema validation

### Development Tools
- **Hot Reload**: Vite dev server with HMR support
- **Type Checking**: Strict TypeScript configuration
- **Error Handling**: Runtime error overlay for development
- **Code Quality**: Shared TypeScript configuration across packages

## Data Flow

### Request Lifecycle
1. Client makes HTTP requests to `/api/*` endpoints
2. Express middleware logs requests and handles CORS
3. Route handlers interact with storage interface
4. Storage layer uses Drizzle ORM for database operations
5. Responses are serialized and sent back to client
6. TanStack Query manages client-side caching and state

### Authentication Flow
- Session-based authentication using PostgreSQL session store
- Credentials stored securely with connect-pg-simple
- Session validation middleware (to be implemented)

### Data Validation
- Zod schemas in shared package for consistent validation
- Frontend form validation using React Hook Form resolvers
- Backend request validation using shared schemas

## External Dependencies

### Database
- **Neon Database**: Serverless PostgreSQL hosting
- **Connection**: Via `@neondatabase/serverless` driver
- **Configuration**: Environment variable `DATABASE_URL`

### UI Components
- **Radix UI**: Unstyled, accessible component primitives
- **Lucide React**: Icon library for consistent iconography
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework

### Development Tools
- **Replit Integration**: Cartographer plugin for code navigation
- **Error Handling**: Runtime error modal for development
- **Bundle Analysis**: Source maps for debugging

## Deployment Strategy

### Build Process
1. Frontend builds to `dist/public` using Vite
2. Backend builds to `dist/` using esbuild
3. Shared types compiled and included in both builds
4. Static assets served from Express in production

### Environment Configuration
- **Development**: Vite dev server with Express API proxy
- **Production**: Express serves static files and API routes
- **Database**: Automatic migration on deployment via `db:push`

### Hosting Considerations
- **Static Assets**: Served by Express in production
- **API Routes**: Express server handles all `/api/*` requests
- **Database**: Neon serverless PostgreSQL with automatic scaling
- **Sessions**: Persistent session storage in PostgreSQL

### Scripts
- `dev`: Development server with hot reload
- `build`: Production build for both frontend and backend  
- `start`: Production server startup
- `db:push`: Deploy database schema changes

The application follows a modern full-stack architecture with clear separation of concerns, type safety throughout the stack, and developer-friendly tooling for rapid iteration.
