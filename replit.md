# MEMOPYK - Replit Project Documentation

## Overview

MEMOPYK is a full-stack memory film platform being rebuilt from scratch. Currently in Phase 1 - minimal React + TypeScript + Vite setup with uploaded MEMOPYK visual assets. The rebuild follows systematic documentation to avoid previous technical failures and implement the complete platform incrementally.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

**Technical Decisions:**
- React Editor Future-Proofing: Consider TipTap as React 19 alternative to ReactQuill when needed
- Track ReactQuill updates for React 19 compatibility improvements
- Prioritize stable, tested solutions over bleeding-edge dependencies

**Analytics Strategy Decision (Jan 22, 2025):**
- Remove hero video tracking (auto-play videos don't provide meaningful analytics)
- Focus analytics on gallery video previews and user engagement  
- Track which gallery items are most popular to inform business decisions

**Analytics Implementation Status (July 26, 2025):**
- ✅ **Hero Video Exclusion Applied**: All analytics methods now filter out VideoHero1.mp4, VideoHero2.mp4, VideoHero3.mp4

- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds
- **UI Library**: shadcn/ui components built on Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with CSS custom properties for theming
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state management
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation resolvers

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **Database ORM**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL dialect
- **Database Provider**: Neon Database (serverless PostgreSQL)
- **Session Management**: Express sessions with PostgreSQL store
- **Build Tool**: esbuild for production builds

### Project Structure
```
├── client/          # React frontend application
├── server/          # Express backend application  
├── shared/          # Shared types, schemas, and utilities
├── migrations/      # Database migration files
└── dist/           # Production build output
```

## Key Components

### Database Layer
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM provides type-safe database operations
- **Schema**: Centralized schema definitions in `shared/schema.ts`
- **Migrations**: Automated database migrations via `drizzle-kit`
- **Connection**: Neon serverless PostgreSQL with connection pooling

### API Layer
- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Routing**: Centralized route registration in `server/routes.ts`
- **Middleware**: Request logging, JSON parsing, error handling
- **Storage Interface**: Abstracted storage layer with in-memory fallback

### Frontend Layer
- **Components**: Comprehensive UI component library from shadcn/ui
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for API state and caching
- **Routing**: Client-side routing (implementation pending)
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod schema validation

### Development Tools
- **Hot Reload**: Vite dev server with HMR support
- **Type Checking**: Strict TypeScript configuration
- **Error Handling**: Runtime error overlay for development
- **Code Quality**: Shared TypeScript configuration across packages

## Data Flow

### Request Lifecycle
1. Client makes HTTP requests to `/api/*` endpoints
2. Express middleware logs requests and handles CORS
3. Route handlers interact with storage interface
4. Storage layer uses Drizzle ORM for database operations
5. Responses are serialized and sent back to client
6. TanStack Query manages client-side caching and state

### Authentication Flow
- Session-based authentication using PostgreSQL session store
- Credentials stored securely with connect-pg-simple
- Session validation middleware (to be implemented)

### Data Validation
- Zod schemas in shared package for consistent validation
- Frontend form validation using React Hook Form resolvers
- Backend request validation using shared schemas

## External Dependencies

### Database
- **Neon Database**: Serverless PostgreSQL hosting
- **Connection**: Via `@neondatabase/serverless` driver
- **Configuration**: Environment variable `DATABASE_URL`

### UI Components
- **Radix UI**: Unstyled, accessible component primitives
- **Lucide React**: Icon library for consistent iconography
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework

### Development Tools
- **Replit Integration**: Cartographer plugin for code navigation
- **Error Handling**: Runtime error modal for development
- **Bundle Analysis**: Source maps for debugging

## Deployment Strategy

### Build Process
1. Frontend builds to `dist/public` using Vite
2. Backend builds to `dist/` using esbuild
3. Shared types compiled and included in both builds
4. Static assets served from Express in production

### Environment Configuration
- **Development**: Vite dev server with Express API proxy
- **Production**: Express serves static files and API routes
- **Database**: Automatic migration on deployment via `db:push`

### Hosting Considerations
- **Static Assets**: Served by Express in production
- **API Routes**: Express server handles all `/api/*` requests
- **Database**: Neon serverless PostgreSQL with automatic scaling
- **Sessions**: Persistent session storage in PostgreSQL

### Scripts
- `dev`: Development server with hot reload
- `build`: Production build for both frontend and backend  
- `start`: Production server startup
- `db:push`: Deploy database schema changes

The application follows a modern full-stack architecture with clear separation of concerns, type safety throughout the stack, and developer-friendly tooling for rapid iteration.

## Previous Status: Phase 8.4.11 - FAQ REORDERING BUG RESOLVED (July 25, 2025)

### COMPLETE FAQ REORDERING FIX - COMPLETED (July 25, 2025)
**Critical FAQ Move Up/Down Functionality Restored:**
✅ **Root Cause Identified**: Multiple FAQs within same sections had duplicate order_index values preventing proper reordering 
✅ **Duplicate Order Fix**: Fixed general section (two FAQs with order_index: 1) and pricing section (two FAQs with order_index: 0)
✅ **Move Functionality Working**: FAQ reordering API endpoints now successfully swap order_index values between questions
✅ **Database Synchronization**: Supabase and JSON backup both updated with correct unique order_index values
✅ **User Testing Ready**: FAQ move up/down buttons in admin panel now functional for all sections
✅ **Production Ready**: Same fix applies to both development and production environments

## Previous Status: Phase 8.4.10 - FAQ PRODUCTION BUG RESOLVED (July 25, 2025)

### CRITICAL FAQ PRODUCTION BUG RESOLUTION - COMPLETED (July 25, 2025)
**Root Cause Production/Development Inconsistency Fixed:**
✅ **Duplicate API Routes Identified**: Found conflicting FAQ endpoints in server/routes.ts causing production failures
✅ **parseInt() Error on UUIDs**: Second set of routes used `parseInt(req.params.id)` which fails on UUID strings like "1f6f3636-a61a-4657-af9c-f3591e949e4b"
✅ **Development vs Production**: Development hit first route handlers (correct string IDs), production hit second handlers (failed parseInt conversion)
✅ **Complete Route Cleanup**: Removed all duplicate routes that used parseInt() on UUID parameters
✅ **Zero TypeScript Errors**: System compiles successfully for production deployment
✅ **API Verification**: All FAQ endpoints now return proper string IDs consistently
✅ **Production Ready**: FAQ system will work identically in both development and production environments

**Technical Root Cause:**
- Lines 852-892 in server/routes.ts contained duplicate FAQ routes
- These routes used `parseInt(req.params.id)` which converts UUID "1f6f3636-a61a-4657-af9c-f3591e949e4b" to `NaN`
- Database lookups with `NaN` failed silently in production
- Development worked by chance hitting the correct string-based routes first
- Removed all conflicting parseInt-based route handlers

**Resolution Impact:**
- FAQ system now works consistently across all environments
- Eliminates confusion between development success and production failure  
- All FAQ CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete, reorder) fully operational
- String ID consistency maintained throughout entire FAQ management system
- Zero risk of parseInt conversion errors on UUID-based primary keys
