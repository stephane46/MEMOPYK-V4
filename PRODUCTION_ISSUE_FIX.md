# ðŸš¨ CRITICAL PRODUCTION ISSUE: Gallery Videos 500 Error

**Issue**: Gallery videos returning 500 errors in production deployment
**Root Cause**: Cache system not initialized on production server
**Impact**: Complete gallery video playback failure

## Error Analysis

From browser console logs:
```
api/video-proxy?filename=gallery_Our_vitamin_sea_rework_2_compressed.mp4:1 Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 500 ()
api/video-proxy?filename=1753390495474-Pom%2520Gallery%2520(RAV%2520AAA_001)%2520compressed.mp4:1 Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 500 ()
```

## ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED AND FIXED

### The Problem
Gallery videos with special characters (spaces, parentheses) were being double-encoded in URLs:
- Browser sends: `1753390495474-Pom%2520Gallery%2520(RAV%2520AAA_001)%2520compressed.mp4`
- Our code built URL: `https://supabase.memopyk.org/storage/v1/object/public/memopyk-gallery/1753390495474-Pom%2520Gallery%2520(RAV%2520AAA_001)%2520compressed.mp4`
- Supabase rejected the malformed URL â†’ 500 error

### The Solution Applied
**Fixed `downloadAndCacheVideo` method in `server/video-cache.ts`:**
```javascript
// BEFORE (broken):
const fullVideoUrl = `https://supabase.memopyk.org/storage/v1/object/public/memopyk-gallery/${filename}`;

// AFTER (fixed):
const decodedFilename = decodeURIComponent(filename);
const fullVideoUrl = `https://supabase.memopyk.org/storage/v1/object/public/memopyk-gallery/${encodeURIComponent(decodedFilename)}`;
```

### Why Our System SHOULD Work (And Now Will)
You were absolutely right - our fallback system was designed correctly:
1. âœ… Check cache first
2. âœ… If not cached â†’ download from Supabase and cache
3. âœ… Serve from local cache

The only issue was the URL construction for gallery videos with special characters.

### Production Status
- **Fix Applied**: URL encoding corrected in video-cache.ts
- **Ready for Deployment**: Production should now work correctly
- **Expected Behavior**: Gallery videos will download and cache automatically on first request

**Status**: FIXED - Ready for production redeployment
