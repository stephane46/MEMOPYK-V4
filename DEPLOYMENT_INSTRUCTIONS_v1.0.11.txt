DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS FOR v1.0.11
===================================

CRITICAL: This deployment MUST include the v1.0.11 gallery video fix.

Before deploying:
1. Ensure all files are saved
2. Check that server/video-cache.ts has the underscore-to-space fix at line 658
3. Verify package.json shows version 1.0.11

The v1.0.11 fix addresses:
- Gallery videos failing with browser Accept-Encoding headers (500 error)
- Force cache endpoint failing due to filename encoding conflicts
- Gallery videos with underscores in filenames not loading properly

Key changes in v1.0.11:
- video-cache.ts line 658: Converts underscores to spaces for gallery videos
- routes.ts: Simplified force cache endpoint to prevent double encoding

After deployment:
1. Test gallery video playback
2. Test force cache button in admin panel
3. Verify deployment version at /api/video-proxy/health endpoint
