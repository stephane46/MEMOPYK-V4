URGENT DEPLOYMENT REQUIRED - v1.0.136 ULTRA DETAILED LOGGING

CURRENT PRODUCTION VERSION: v1.0.1754927210.FIXED_BOTH_SOURCE (OUTDATED)
REQUIRED PRODUCTION VERSION: v1.0.1754932191.ULTRA_DETAILED_LOGGING (READY)

STATUS: Both frontend and backend now properly synchronized with ultra-detailed logging

CHANGES CONFIRMED:
✅ Backend: server/routes.ts VERSION = "v1.0.1754932191.ULTRA_DETAILED_LOGGING"
✅ Frontend: SimpleVideoPlayer.tsx VERSION = "v1.0.1754932191.ULTRA_DETAILED_LOGGING"
✅ Ultra-detailed console.error logging for production visibility
✅ Complete hero vs gallery video comparison tracking
✅ HEAD request support for browser compatibility

CRITICAL ISSUE: Gallery videos return 500 errors in production while hero videos work perfectly
SOLUTION: Ultra-detailed logging will reveal exact failure point

DEPLOY IMMEDIATELY TO UPDATE PRODUCTION TO CORRECT VERSION.

After deployment, production should show:
"SIMPLE VIDEO PLAYER v1.0.1754932191.ULTRA_DETAILED_LOGGING - ULTRA DETAILED LOGGING FOR PRODUCTION DEBUG"

Then production logs will capture complete diagnostic information for both video types.
