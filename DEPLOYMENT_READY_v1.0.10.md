# DEPLOYMENT READY - v1.0.10 FINAL FIX

## Critical Fix Applied
The double encoding bug has been fixed in v1.0.10. The key change is in `server/routes.ts` lines 1302-1313:

```javascript
// CRITICAL FIX v1.0.10: Always use original decoded filename for Supabase URL construction
const encodedForDownload = encodeURIComponent(decodedFilename);
const supabaseUrl = `https://supabase.memopyk.org/storage/v1/object/public/memopyk-gallery/${encodedForDownload}`;
```

## Build Status
✅ Production build completed at: 2025-07-27T22:02:45.657Z
✅ Frontend bundle: 1,365.89 kB (index-BKLGAlG8.js)
✅ Backend: v1.0.10 with double encoding fix

## What This Fixes
- Gallery videos with special characters (parentheses, spaces) now work correctly
- Prevents double encoding that caused 500 errors
- Example: `1753390495474-Pom Gallery (RAV AAA_001) compressed.mp4` will now load properly

## Deployment Instructions
1. Go to Replit Deployments tab
2. Click "Redeploy" 
3. Ensure the deployment uses the latest build from 22:02 UTC

## Verification
After deployment, the problematic gallery video should return 206 status (success) instead of 500 error.

**IMPORTANT**: The deployment logs showing v1.0.9 errors are from an OLD BUILD. You need to redeploy with the NEW BUILD created at 22:02 UTC that includes v1.0.10.
