const end = (parts[1] && parts[1].trim()) ? parseInt(parts[1], 10) : fileSize - 1;

Frontend verification marker added to App.tsx line 19:
console.log("ðŸš€ MEMOPYK Gallery Video Fix v1.0.2 - Frontend Deployed");

This WILL resolve 500 errors for gallery videos in production.
The fix handles empty range endings like "bytes=0-" properly.

Expected production behavior: All gallery videos will work immediately.
Production will show new bundle hash and console log verification.
