FORCE DEPLOYMENT v1.0.8 - Gallery Video Complete Fix

CRITICAL: Production deployment cache issue detected
- Frontend shows v1.0.7 but v1.0.8 was deployed
- Backend fixes for URL encoding not reaching production
- 500 errors still occurring due to old code running

SOLUTION: Force clear deployment
1. Server version updated to v1.0.8 
2. New build created with proper version
3. Ready for redeployment with cache clearing

Expected Result After Deployment:
- Console should show "Gallery Video Fix v1.0.8"
- Gallery videos should work on first click
- Auto-download with proper URL encoding active
